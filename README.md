# dcnation

## How to use
* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system.
* [Download this repository](https://github.com/tsurugi97/dcnation/archive/master.zip) with all files or just [calculator.js](https://github.com/tsurugi97/dcnation/blob/master/calculator.js)
* Open a terminal (cmd in Windows) and cd into the location on your computer where [calculator.js](https://github.com/tsurugi97/dcnation/blob/master/calculator.js) is kept.
* Execute the code `node ./calculator.js [filename]` without the square brackets where **filename** is the text file that you would like to parse for automated calculation for the abilities.

## Calculation expectations
* Ensure that all abilities have the level listed next to the ability (LV[num],LV [num], LVL[num], and LVL [num] are all currently working right now).
* Also make sure to put down the XP cost for each ability, so that the program knows what to do with the calculation (XP[num] or XP [num] are both fine).

## Expected output
* You will see a list of numbers for each ability, designated in the form of an array.
* You will also see the overall sum of all of the abilities.
